 Definition:


A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are connected using pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require a contiguous block of memory, making dynamic memory allocation easier.


 Types of Linked Lists:


1.Singly Linked List – Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.

2.Doubly Linked List – Each node has a pointer to both the next and previous nodes.

3.Circular Linked List – The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.


Structure of a Node (Singly Linked List):
Each node consists of:

Data (stores the value)
Pointer (next) (stores the address of the next node)
Example:

css
Copy code
Head → [10 | *] → [20 | *] → [30 | null]


Advantages of Linked Lists:


✔ Dynamic Size – Can grow or shrink as needed.
✔ Efficient Insertions/Deletions – No shifting required like in arrays.


Disadvantages:


✖ More Memory – Extra space needed for pointers.
✖ Slower Access – No direct indexing like arrays.


Applications of Linked Lists:


Memory management (dynamic allocation)
Implementing stacks and queues
Undo/redo operations
Graph representations (Adjacency list)
